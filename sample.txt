Speed reading is a collection of techniques that aim to increase reading speed without an unacceptable reduction in comprehension or retention. The most effective methods involve reducing subvocalization, expanding peripheral vision, and using rapid serial visual presentation.

RSVP, or Rapid Serial Visual Presentation, is a technique where words are displayed one at a time in the same position on a screen. This eliminates the need for eye movements, which can significantly slow down reading. Studies have shown that people can read at speeds of 300 to 1000 words per minute using this method, compared to typical reading speeds of 200 to 300 words per minute.

The key to effective RSVP is the Optimal Reading Point, or ORP. This is the position in each word where the eye should focus. Research shows that the ORP is typically around the middle of the word, slightly left of center. By aligning all words at this point, readers can process text more efficiently.

Modern technology has made RSVP more accessible than ever. With smartphones and tablets, anyone can turn their device into a powerful speed reading tool. The combination of OCR technology and RSVP opens up new possibilities for reading physical books at enhanced speeds.
